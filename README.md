# Probabilistic Models in Sports Analytics

This project explores the application of **probabilistic graphical models**, specifically **Bayesian networks**, within the realm of **sports analytics**. Using real-world data, it demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for visualizing dependencies and making probabilistic predictions about sports team performance.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The core of this project is a Jupyter notebook that walks through how to:

- 📥 Import and preprocess sports data
- 🔄 Construct and visualize a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** to represent variable relationships
- 🎯 Define target teams for performance prediction
- 🔍 Apply **Bayesian networks** to extract insights and forecast outcomes
